# about function qnorm：
#The next function we look at is qnorm which is the inverse of pnorm. The idea behind qnorm is that you give it a probability, and it returns the number whose cumulative distribution matches the probability. For example, if you have a normally distributed random variable with mean zero and standard deviation one, then if you give the function a probability it returns the associated Z-score:
qnorm(0.15,mean=50,sd=8)
qnorm(0.95,mean=50,sd=8)
