#Lecture 4. mean and median
#In-Class Exercise 1
# The following three columns make up a single distribution of scores that were obtained by 18 students on a test.  Compute the mean, median, and mode of this distribution of scores.
values <- c(2,	11,	16,
5,	11,	16,
7,	12,	18,
9,	14,	19,
9,	14,	22,
9,	14,	24)

# For the set of raw score values (X) shown below, compute the mean.

#
# 1. Using the mean you calculated above, evaluate the following expression for this set of numbers (the sum of the squared deviations about the mean):
#
#
#   2. Now, add 1 to the mean and evaluate the following expression (the sum of the squared deviations about the mean-plus-1):
#
#
#   3. Subtract 1 from the mean and evaluate the following expression (the sum of the squared deviations about the mean-minus-1):
